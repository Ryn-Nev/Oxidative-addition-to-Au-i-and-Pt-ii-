# Oxidative-addition-to-Au-i-and-Pt-ii-
Electronic files accompanying the article : Intermolecular interactions behind the oxidative addition of diatomic halogens to Au(i) and Pt(ii) complexes†.

## Atomic coordinates
Atomic coordinates of the optimized complexes, halogens and their respective adducts can be found within the repository. 
The files for the atomic coordinates of the complexes and the adducts are labelled as

    Ligand_HalogenLigand

and

    Ligand_HalogenLigand_Position_X2species

respectively.

where the **Ligand** is either the phosphine, isocyanide or N-heterocyclic carbene being investigated, the **HalogenLigand** is the Br, Cl or I atom coordinated to the metal centre, the **X2species** is the Br2, Cl2 or I2 species which is used to form an adducts with the metal complex and **Position** is the whether the X2 species was initial placed at the metal centre or the HalogenLigand prior to geometry optimisation.


_Note: all xyz files contain the energy of the strucutre along with the 3 lowest (IR) vibrational frequencies of the strucuture._

## EDA results
EDA results for the optimised adducts are also available as csv files. The labelling is the same as above.
